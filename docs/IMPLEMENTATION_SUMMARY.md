# AI Hub Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the work done to connect the AI Hub frontend to the backend and implement the core functionality of the application.

## Projects Page

The `Projects` page was initially partially implemented and relied on sample data. The following tasks were completed to make it fully functional:

- **Updated `Project` Type**: The `Project` type definition in `src/lib/supabase.ts` was updated to include the `progress` property.
- **Created `NewProjectModal`**: A new modal component was created at `src/components/NewProjectModal.tsx` to allow users to create new projects.
- **Integrated Modal**: The `NewProjectModal` was integrated into the `Projects.tsx` page and is now displayed when the "New Project" button is clicked.
- **Implemented "Favorite" Functionality**: Users can now mark projects as favorites, and the changes are persisted in the database.
- **Implemented "View" Functionality**: A new page was created at `src/pages/ProjectView.tsx` to display the details of a single project. The "View" button on the project cards now links to this page.

## Knowledge Page

The `Knowledge` page was initially a static placeholder. The following tasks were completed to make it fully functional:

- **Fetched and Displayed Knowledge Items**: The page now fetches and displays knowledge items from the `knowledge_items` table in the database.
- **Implemented Category Filters**: Users can now filter knowledge items by category (Research Papers, AI Prompts, Code Templates, Notes).
- **Implemented Keyword Search**: Users can now search for knowledge items by keyword.
- **Created `NewKnowledgeItemModal`**: A new modal component was created at `src/components/NewKnowledgeItemModal.tsx` to allow users to add new knowledge items.
- **Integrated Modal**: The `NewKnowledgeItemModal` was integrated into the `Knowledge.tsx` page and is now displayed when the "Add Knowledge" button is clicked.
- **Implemented "Favorite" Functionality**: Users can now mark knowledge items as favorites, and the changes are persisted in the database.

## Analytics Page

The `Analytics` page was initially a static placeholder. The following tasks were completed to implement its core functionality:

- **Fetched Data**: The page now fetches data from the `ai_content`, `projects`, and `user_hackathons` tables to calculate analytics metrics.
- **Calculated and Displayed Key Metrics**: The key metric cards at the top of the page now display dynamic data from the database.
- **Added Bar Chart**: A bar chart was added to the page using the `recharts` library to visualize the number of papers read per month.

## Conclusion

The core functionality of the AI Hub application is now connected and working. The `Projects`, `Knowledge`, and `Analytics` pages are fully functional, and the application is ready for further development and new features.
